# python-api-workout-tracker

# This application is designed to collect workout information from a user.  If the workout was a run, the application will add it to a worksheet in a google spreadsheet to track the run information. 

# create a spreadsheet with a worksheet in google sheets designed to track run information

# front the worksheet with an API (using sheety.co) that allows the application to insert, update, delete rows into the run worksheet.  

# queries the user using natural language processing (using nutritionix.com) to find out what workout they did and calculate how many calories they burned.
# Note: nutritionix.com doesn't collect details on how far a user has run, so i've added custom code to extract distance from the query OR prompt the user with follow up regarding distance run.
